                Hello! I'm Esther Lim and I am studying advertising wanting to persure 
                my career in social media marketing and media advertisment. When I started
                my first CSS class, I was really unsure about it because I have never done 
                any sort of coding before. Later on after practicing and creating many projects,
                I really found CSS to be really interesting. I enjoyed learnig how to create my
                own websites and I do think I find it useful for my futher career with Business and Advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I continue to expand my knowledge using CSS for future uses, I hope to continue to learn more 
                about it and learn more advance CSS. I was able to create my own website page as you can see here 
                and add one of my favorite photos and the next page is my resume.
