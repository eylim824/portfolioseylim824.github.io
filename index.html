                                Hi! My name is Esther Lim. Currently I am a student at the University of Oregon studying Advertising. I've had an interest in 
                                social media marketing and also creating different Ad campaigns.I started to learn how to take pictures professionally 
                                back in high school with just a digital camera. I sometimes like to use my photos for certain things to create my own
                                social media marketing for practice which is why I started taking pictures of object more seriously. I few years back I was taking pictures
                                of my friends and started to also have an interest of learning how to take a proper photo of people.
                                I have started my Photo Gallery and added many photos of my friends, outdoor nature, and more.

                The pictures I have displayed below are a few sample pictures I took from both my phone and my digital camera. 
                I am also free to take pictures of anyone who is interested whether it's for any instagram, profile, professional, 
                or senior/graduation photos. I will continue to update and add more of my work and continue to take pictures and expand my interest
                on photography.
